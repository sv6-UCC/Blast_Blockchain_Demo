<h1>Blockchain Demo</h1>

A web-based demonstration of blockchain concepts.<br/><br/>
This is a complete rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/anders94/blockchain-demo">Anders Brownworth's
  Blockchain Demo</a> with lots of additional features.<br/>
Basically only the idea shown in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8">excellent Demo
  Video</a> remains, the code is completely different.
<br/><br/>

If you are looking for the cryptographic tools that were found behind the
&quot;Advanced&quot; menu, <a href="https://guggero.github.io/cryptography-toolkit">they have been moved
  to their own project]</a>.

<ul>
  <li>Static HTML/JS, so it can be served with GitHub Pages</li>
  <li>Use AngularJS for rendering the page</li>
  <li>Add explanations to most pages</li>
  <li>Expert Mode that shows many details</li>
  <li>Show/implement concept of mining difficulty (in Expert Mode)</li>
  <li>Show duration and speed of mining process (in Expert Mode)</li>
